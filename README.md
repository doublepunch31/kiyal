# Kiyal

Kiyal (Kyrgyz *кыял*, "dream") is an LLM inference engine and OpenAI-compatible server, built
from scratch in PyTorch.

## Status

Early development. The project skeleton is in place: packaging, linting, type checking, tests, a
`kiyal` command-line entry point, and automatic device and dtype selection (CUDA, MPS or CPU). The
model, KV cache, batching and server are not implemented yet.

## Setup

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). uv installs Python 3.12 if it is missing.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/doublepunch31/kiyal.git
cd kiyal
uv sync --extra cpu
uv run kiyal --help
```

The `cpu` extra installs PyTorch's CPU-only build on Linux and the standard build on macOS, which
runs on Apple Silicon GPUs through MPS. An install option for NVIDIA GPUs will be added with the
first GPU benchmarks.

## Development

```sh
uv run ruff format && uv run ruff check   # format and lint
uv run pyright                            # type-check
uv run pytest -m "not slow"               # fast tests
uv run pytest                             # all tests, including those that download weights
```
